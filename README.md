Thank you for your interest in Matterport3D. Please use the following script to download the Matterport3D data: http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/matterport/download_mp.py. 

Some useful info:
Scan data is named by a house hash id. The list of house hash ids is at http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/matterport/v1/scans.txt 
Script usage:
- To download the entire Matterport3D release (1.3TB): download-mp.py -o [directory in which to download] 
- To download a specific scan (e.g., 17DRP5sb8fy): download-mp.py -o [directory in which to download] --id 17DRP5sb8fy

- To download a specific file type (e.g., *.sens, valid file suffixes listed here): download-mp.py -o [directory in which to download] --type .sens
- *.sens files can be read using the sens-File reader (it's a bit easier to handle than a larger number of separate image files)
